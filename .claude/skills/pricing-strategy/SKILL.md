Input: $ARGUMENTS

## Before you start

Read `.claude/skills/pricing-strategy/conventions.md` and follow it, if it is present.

- Reads: `founder/facts.md`, `founder/product-brief.md`, `founder/competitor-matrix.md`, `founder/persona-gen.md`, `founder/mvp-scope.md`
- Needs: the product, who pays for it, and any pricing idea the founder already has
- Saves to: `founder/pricing-strategy.md`

If `founder/competitor-matrix.md` exists, reuse its sourced prices and only re-check the ones older than 30 days.

## Instructions

### 1. Pricing model analysis

Score each model 1-5 for this specific product:

| Model | Fit score | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-----------|------|------|
| Flat subscription | | | |
| Usage-based | | | |
| Per-seat | | | |
| Freemium | | | |
| Credits | | | |
| One-time purchase | | | |

Recommend one model and say why.

### 2. Tier design

Design 3 tiers with names, prices, and features:

- **Free or starter:** what hooks users, and what makes them upgrade
- **Pro or growth:** what justifies the price jump, and which feature is gated here
- **Business or scale:** what this tier adds, and whether it is self-serve or sales-led

For each tier:
- Monthly and annual price, with the annual discount %
- 5-8 features with limits (not "advanced analytics")
- The upgrade trigger: what makes someone outgrow this tier

### 3. Competitive pricing context

3-5 competitors' current prices, each with a link to the pricing page and the date checked:
- Competitor name, price, what's included
- Where the founder's product should sit relative to each (above, below, between) and why

### 4. Unit economics check

- Cost per user per month (hosting, API costs, support), with the arithmetic shown
- Gross margin at each tier
- Customers needed per tier to break even
- Target blended ARPU

Mark every cost you couldn't confirm as an estimate.

### 5. Pricing psychology

3 specific tactics:
- Anchoring: which tier is the anchor?
- Decoy: is there a tier designed to push people to the target tier?
- Annual framing: how to present the annual discount

### 6. Launch pricing vs. scale pricing

- **Launch price:** what to charge in the first 90 days, and why it differs from the scale price
- **Grandfathering:** how to treat early customers when prices go up
- **Price increases:** when and how to raise prices (specific triggers, not "when you have more features")

## Rules

- Real numbers: "$29/mo", not "affordable pricing".
- Every recommendation has a "because".
- If the founder's pricing idea is wrong, say so and explain why.
- Keep total output under 1500 words.
